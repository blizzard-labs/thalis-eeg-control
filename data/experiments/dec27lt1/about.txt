OBSERVATIONS:
- Raw Trace Recording split into three phases: (1) regular measurement (2) lower frequency (3) complete Glitching
--> Could be cause of multithreading/processsing issues?
--> Related issue?: CSV file is unordered for larger time entries
- No Known Bluetooth connection issues
- Complete Dataset collected, however unordered
- How to begin testing procedure + data collection simultaneously?
- Electrode PQ7 Extremely tight... painful
- Hand movement not observed in phone camera: record with laptop next time + shutdown mid recording

MORE CONSOLE SPECIFIC ISSUES:
- "Filtered data" not showing
- Signal "quality" innacurate
- RMS Error not working
